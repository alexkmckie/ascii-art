# ASCII Pop-up Feature

This version of `make_art.py` in the example folders utilizes the Python built-in package `tkinter` to create a pop-up 
window of the ASCII art. The standard program doesn't produce scaled images; users have to change their settings in 
their IDE program to get the right font size.

This version currently uses the font: Courier, and there are four options for font sizes: small (2), medium (6), 
large (10), and extra-large (14). In the font size dictionary, there is also a corresponding value that is the 
character aspect ratio. There isn't a way to automatically get this value; it's from trial and error.

To run this program run  python3 ascii_popup/make_art_popup.py  {your image path}
from you root folder containing the program

## Testing

The original program doesn't have any unit tests in place, so I have added tests to the functions I have created 
or altered.

## Documentation

There are no guidelines for how to document and comment the code for the project.
I have done docstrings for all functions I have edited or created.
